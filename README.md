[ IN PROGRESS ]

mytechportfolio.com aims to streamline the nuances of building an eye-catching tech portfolio by providing users with a platform to simply fill out their details such as their projects, experiences, and other assets and provides templates to choose from. 

How is this different from other website builders such as Wix and web flow - while these no-code solutions are very useful, they don't serve the purpose of showcasing your projects well, users will have to design a website, work out the SEO, also user experience is very time-consuming - the idea here to allow users to focus more on building their projects than maintaining the website, for example, a cyber security engineer might have some projects they want to showcase - will they design a website or simply add their projects and pick a template? to be honest, we can add projects to LinkedIn as well, but this is not effective when you try to reach out to someone via cold email, they would always ask "Can I see some of your work?", that's where if you have a portfolio to showcase your work - chances are they would want to interview you!
